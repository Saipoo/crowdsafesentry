Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered CrowdSafe Website

1. Product Overview

1.1 Purpose

The CrowdSafe website is an AI-powered platform designed to prevent stampedes and ensure safety during public gatherings involving celebrities, politicians, or sports figures in Bengaluru and other regions. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the platform automates crowd prediction, event planning, police coordination, and public awareness, ensuring strict police approval before celebrities can proceed with events.

1.2 Objectives





Prevent Stampedes: Use AI to predict crowd sizes, monitor real-time crowd density, and trigger alerts to avoid overcrowding.



Enforce Police Approval: Ensure celebrities/organizers receive explicit police approval before proceeding with events.



Automate Coordination: Enable seamless, AI-driven communication among celebrities/event organizers, police, and the public.



Enhance Public Safety: Provide real-time safety advisories, crowd management plans, and emergency response integration.



Ensure Scalability: Design a solution applicable to Bengaluru and adaptable to other cities with similar challenges.

1.3 Scope

The platform will include:





AI-driven crowd prediction, real-time monitoring, and event planning.



Strict police approval process for all events, with no celebrity appearances allowed without approval.



Public-facing dashboard for event details and safety advisories.



Role-based access control (RBAC) for public, celebrities/organizers, and police.



No manual admin role; all administrative tasks (e.g., user management, event approvals) are automated by AI, with high-risk cases escalated to police.



Advanced features like chatbot support, blockchain transparency, and AR/VR simulations.

2. Target Audience





Public: Individuals attending events, seeking safety information and crowd updates.



Celebrities/Event Organizers: Individuals or teams planning public appearances, requiring police-approved safe event coordination.



Police: Local law enforcement responsible for crowd control, event approval, and security.


System handles 10,000 concurrent users during peak events.



AI predictions generated within 10 seconds.



Real-time alerts delivered within 30 seconds.



Chatbot responses under 5 seconds.

4.2 Scalability





Cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) to support scaling across multiple cities.



Handle 100+ simultaneous events with real-time monitoring.

4.3 Security





OAuth/JWT for user authentication.



Encrypted communication for police and organizer data.



Blockchain for secure, transparent logging of event approvals and crowd data.



Compliance with India’s Personal Data Protection Bill.

4.4 Accessibility





Multilingual interface (Kannada, Hindi, English).



Mobile-responsive design and dedicated mobile app for notifications.



AR/VR simulations accessible on standard browsers and mobile devices.

4.5 Reliability





99.9% uptime for website and API services.



Redundant systems for real-time monitoring to prevent data loss.

5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)





Public:





Access: View approved event details, crowd predictions, safety advisories, chatbot support.



Restrictions: No access to event planning or police dashboards.



Celebrities/Event Organizers:





Access: Submit event requests, view AI-generated plans, receive approval status, use chatbot and AR/VR simulations.



Restrictions: No access to police dashboard or real-time monitoring data; cannot proceed without police approval.



Police:





Access: Review event requests, approve/reject events, view crowd predictions, real-time monitoring, coordination dashboard, blockchain logs.



Restrictions: Cannot submit event requests or edit public advisories.

6. Technical Architecture





Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive, role-based UI.



Backend: Node.js/Express for API handling; Python for AI/ML models.



Database: PostgreSQL for event and user data; MongoDB for real-time crowd data.



AI/ML:





Crowd prediction: Scikit-learn/TensorFlow for regression/time-series models.



Real-time monitoring: OpenCV/YOLO for crowd density analysis.



Event planning: Recommendation algorithms with GIS integration.



Chatbot: Grok API (via x.ai/api) for natural language processing.



AR/VR: Three.js/WebXR for crowd simulations.



Blockchain: Ethereum/Hyperledger for transparent logging.



Integrations:





Social media APIs (e.g., X API) for sentiment analysis.



GIS APIs for venue and traffic data.



IoT/CCTV for real-time crowd monitoring.



Google Maps for route optimization.



Public transport APIs for transport coordination.



Cloud: AWS for hosting, scalability, and storage (S3 for event plans, RDS for database).

7. Success Metrics





Safety: Reduce stampede incidents by 90% in pilot cities within 12 months.



Compliance: 100% of events proceed only after police approval.



Adoption: 50% of public event organizers in Bengaluru use the platform within 6 months.



Accuracy: AI crowd predictions accurate within ±10% for 80% of events.



Response Time: Police receive alerts within 30 seconds of risk detection.



User Satisfaction: 85% positive feedback from public, organizers, and police.



Chatbot Effectiveness: 90% of queries resolved without escalation.



Blockchain Transparency: 100% of event approvals logged and accessible.

8. Risks and Mitigations





Risk: Limited police resources for large events.





Mitigation: AI prioritizes high-risk events and optimizes resource allocation; integrates with emergency services.



Risk: Inaccurate crowd predictions due to limited data.





Mitigation: Use social media and historical data; implement feedback loop for model retraining.



Risk: Low public adoption.





Mitigation: Launch awareness campaigns via X, local media, and community outreach.



Risk: Technical failures during peak usage.





Mitigation: Use cloud scaling and redundant systems for 99.9% uptime.



Risk: Resistance to police approval requirement.





Mitigation: Educate organizers on safety benefits; enforce via system locks.
