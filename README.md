Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered CrowdSafe Website

1. Product Overview

1.1 Purpose

The CrowdSafe website is an AI-powered platform designed to prevent stampedes and ensure safety during public gatherings involving celebrities, politicians, or sports figures in Bengaluru and other regions. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the platform automates crowd prediction, event planning, police coordination, and public awareness, ensuring strict police approval before celebrities can proceed with events.

1.2 Objectives





Prevent Stampedes: Use AI to predict crowd sizes, monitor real-time crowd density, and trigger alerts to avoid overcrowding.



Enforce Police Approval: Ensure celebrities/organizers receive explicit police approval before proceeding with events.



Automate Coordination: Enable seamless, AI-driven communication among celebrities/event organizers, police, and the public.



Enhance Public Safety: Provide real-time safety advisories, crowd management plans, and emergency response integration.



Ensure Scalability: Design a solution applicable to Bengaluru and adaptable to other cities with similar challenges.

1.3 Scope

The platform will include:





AI-driven crowd prediction, real-time monitoring, and event planning.



Strict police approval process for all events, with no celebrity appearances allowed without approval.



Public-facing dashboard for event details and safety advisories.



Role-based access control (RBAC) for public, celebrities/organizers, and police.



No manual admin role; all administrative tasks (e.g., user management, event approvals) are automated by AI, with high-risk cases escalated to police.



Advanced features like chatbot support, blockchain transparency, and AR/VR simulations.

2. Target Audience





Public: Individuals attending events, seeking safety information and crowd updates.
